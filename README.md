# Data Description
The dataset contains the following information:
Customer Demographics: Age, gender, marital status, income, education level, etc.
Driving Context: Destination, weather, passenger type, time of day, etc.

# Coupon Details 
Bars
Coffee Houses
Restaurants (less than $20)
Restaurants ($20â€“$50)
Carryout and takeaway
Response to Coupons:
Y = 1: Accepted the coupon.
Y = 0: Did not accept the coupon.

# Objectives
In this task, the characteristics of customers who accept coupons have been identified.

# Findings
The dataset has 6 columns with missing data: car, Bar, CoffeeHouse, CarryAway, RestaurantLessThan20 and Restaurant20To50, where the column 'car' has the most missing data 99.1%

Frequent bar-goers (>3 visits/month) are more likely to accept bar coupons on an individual basis (higher acceptance rate within their group). However, the majority of total coupon acceptances come from less frequent bar-goers (<=3 visits/month), likely due to their larger representation in the population.

Older and more frequent bar-goers (Group 1) are more likely to accept bar-related coupons compared to the younger and less frequent visitors (Group 2).

The drivers with lower incomes (< $50K) has higher acceptance rate. It might be they accepted coupons as an opportunity for cost savings, potentially making them more receptive to bar coupons.

The drivers without children have a higher tendency to accept coupons.
This can help the targeted coupon strategies, to offer coupons for those without children

#Visualizations
The analysis includes several visualizations using pie, bar and histogram.
